## Introduction
-------
Since Chinese reform and opening, the Chinese economy has developed rapidly. However, due to the regional unbalanced economic developments, the economic vitality (EV) has a huge gap between different cities. At the same time, due to economic transformation and industrial structure adjustment, Chinese provinces and cities face different economic policy challenges. As a result, an objective and comprehensive evaluation of the regional economic vitality and exploring the reasons for such differences to achieve sustainable development of regional coordination is of great significance. In this research, we want to study China’s city-level economic vitality index. The regional economic dynamic is an important indicator to evaluate the economic development in China. It is a helpful indicator for understanding the regional economic development status quo and future economic potential. However, there is no single standard and definition of economic vitality. Due to the complexity of indicators and external influencing factors, it is difficult to use a single factor to estimate economic vitality. Therefore, in this research, we want to use data analysis skills to build a model for economic vitality estimation and a reference for the following study. Besides, we work on two representative cities, Beijing and Weihai, and try to give policy alternatives to foster the development of EV.

## Policy Alternatives
-------
We propose two policy alternatives, that is, to raise the importance of environmental issues at the national strategic level and to accelerate the energy transition to break the mutual constraint between economic development and environmental protection. We suggest that the Chinese government should introduce policies to bring more development opportunities to marginal cities such as Weihai in the post-epidemic era when the economic development of first-tier cities such as Beijing has slowed down. Ang the formation of an urban agglomeration with neighboring Qingdao and Jinan, which are more well-developed cities, is a feasible and highly profitable policy option. In addition, how to break the constraint between economic development and environmental protection should be an urgent consideration for all economists and environmental advocates. We believe that the renewable energy transition will not only effectively solve the problem of energy scarcity in industrial development, but also promote the emergence of Chinese industries such as photovoltaics, wind energy, and lithium batteries, thus ensuring the continued cites’ EV [(Marrone & Montella, 2022)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2667095X22000095?via%3Dihub).
